# SRCHack - (probably) The first hacked client for Minecraft c0.0.11 (aka c0.0.12a-dev in Betacraft launcher)


Hello there, I was bored and decided to make this. It's interesting, trust me.

One of the useful things about this client is that it adds flying, which wasn't present in any Minecraft Classic versions, which often makes it a nuisance to build large structures.
I highly recommend the Betacraft launcher for using this client. https://betacraft.uk/downloads
I recommend checking this page every once in a while, in case I make a new release of the client that includes more hacks, bugfixes and improvements.

Unfortunatly due to copyright issues, I cannot release the source code because it would also show the source code for this Minecraft version, which would technically not be legal. Due to no Forge/Fabric for this version of Minecraft, I must directly modify the code of the game, so I would technically be making private copyrighted code (Minecraft source code) public.

I know it's stupid because this is such an old version of the game that I've modded, however copyright is copyright.
# Installation
## How to install on Windows (XP/7/8/10/11)
1. On Windows, go your %appdata% folder using the 'Run' thingy, and find your '.betacraft' folder. On MacOS, go to ~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft . Copy and paste that into the little magnifiying glass icon in the top right of your screen, and press enter.
2. Go into the 'versions' folder. If you see a file called 'c0.0.12a-dev.jar', delete it because it'll interfere with the next step. If you don't have that file, you don't need to do anything.
3. Drag the SRCHack jar into the versions folder, and rename it to 'c0.0.12a-dev.jar'. 

## How to install on MacOS (Any OS version that is compatible with Betacraft Launcher)
Use the Spotlight search app in the top right of your screen and type '~/library/Application support/betacraft if you're on an older version. You can't do that on the new MacOS versions however (10.14.6 and up, I believe), so you'll have to find it in Finder by going to the Devices tab and going into a specific library folder. I won't specify how to do it here, you can search up on Google how to find the application support folder yourself.

## How to install on Linux-based operating systems
In order to install, open your terminal emulator of choice, and you must go to your home folder `cd ~/` and if you launched betacraft and installed c0.0.11 (aka c0.0.12a-dev) there should be a .betacraft folder, type `cd .betacraft` and then go to the versions folder, `cd versions` now replace the "c0.0.12a-dev.jar" file with the one you downloaded from Releases, launch betacraft and start c0.0.12a-dev and you should have the mod installed! Enjoy!

That's all you need to do. Enjoy!
If you want to use the Minecraft official launcher (not recommended), search "How to add version to Minecraft launcher from jar" on Google and select the video result. I'm too lazy to type it all here, and I do not test the client on the official launcher, and I won't provide bugfixes for the official launcher so it may stop working at any time because the Minecraft official launcher has terrible support for old Minecraft versions. Use the Betacraft launcher if you want to be 100% sure that the game will work, since that's what I test the client on.
