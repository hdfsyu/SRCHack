# SRCHack - The first hacked client for Minecraft c0.0.11 (aka c0.0.12a-dev in Betacraft launcher)

# THE FILES FOR THE CLIENT WILL BE ADDED TO THIS REPOSITORY SOON; THIS WAS JUST MADE IN PREPARATION.



Hello there. I was bored and decided to make this. It's interesting, trust me.
The main good thing about this client is that it adds flying, which wasn't present in Minecraft classic versions.
I highly recommend the Betacraft launcher for using this client. https://betacraft.uk/downloads
I recommend checking this page every once in a while, in case I make a new release of the client that includes more hacks, bugfixes and improvements.

# How to install
1. On Windows, go your %appdata% folder using the 'Run' thingy, and find your '.betacraft' folder. On MacOS, go to ~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft . Copy and paste that into the little magnifiying glass icon in the top right of your screen, and press enter.
2. Go into the 'versions' folder. If you see a file called 'c0.0.12a-dev.jar', delete it because it'll interfere with the next step. If you don't have that file, you don't need to do anything.
3. Drag the SRCHack jar into the versions folder, and rename it to 'c0.0.12a-dev.jar'. 

That's all you need to do. Enjoy!
